# OAuth Authentication Fixes

## Problem
The app was experiencing sign-in issues on real devices while working fine in the simulator. This is a common issue with web authentication flows, particularly Google OAuth, due to security policies that are stricter on real devices.

## Root Causes
1. **Network Security Configuration**: Missing proper SSL certificate handling
2. **User Agent Issues**: WebView user agent was being flagged as insecure
3. **Mixed Content**: Security warnings due to mixed HTTP/HTTPS content
4. **SSL Certificate Handling**: Inadequate handling of SSL certificate challenges

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Android Network Security Configuration
- **File**: `android/app/src/main/res/xml/network_security_config.xml`
- **Changes**: Added proper SSL certificate handling for OAuth domains
- **Impact**: Allows secure connections to Google OAuth endpoints

### 2. Enhanced WebView Settings
- **File**: `lib/views/web_viewer.dart`
- **Changes**: 
  - Updated user agent to a more standard Chrome mobile user agent
  - Enhanced SSL certificate handling for OAuth flows
  - Improved error handling with specific OAuth error messages
  - Added retry functionality for failed authentication attempts

### 3. iOS App Transport Security
- **File**: `ios/Runner/Info.plist`
- **Changes**: Added specific domain exceptions for Google OAuth domains
- **Impact**: Ensures proper TLS handling on iOS devices

### 4. Better Error Handling
- **File**: `lib/views/web_viewer.dart`
- **Changes**:
  - Specific error messages for different OAuth error codes
  - Retry functionality for failed authentication
  - Better debugging information for troubleshooting

## Key Improvements

### User Agent
- **Before**: Generic WebView user agent
- **After**: Standard Chrome mobile user agent that's widely accepted

### SSL Certificate Handling
- **Before**: Basic SSL certificate acceptance
- **After**: Domain-specific SSL certificate handling for OAuth flows

### Error Messages
- **Before**: Generic HTTP error messages
- **After**: Specific OAuth error messages with actionable guidance

## Testing

### To test the fixes:

1. **Clean and rebuild the app**:
   ```bash
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   ```

2. **Test on real device**:
   - Build and install the app on a real device
   - Try the sign-in flow
   - Check for any error messages in the console

3. **Debug information**:
   - The app now logs detailed information about OAuth flows
   - Look for messages starting with üîê, üîí, ‚ùå, ‚úÖ in the console

## Common Error Messages and Solutions

### "This browser or app may not be secure"
- **Cause**: User agent or SSL certificate issues
- **Solution**: The new user agent and SSL handling should resolve this

### "Try using a different browser"
- **Cause**: WebView security restrictions
- **Solution**: Enhanced WebView settings and network security configuration

### HTTP 403 Errors
- **Cause**: Access denied due to security policies
- **Solution**: Updated user agent and SSL certificate handling

## Additional Notes

- The app now shows user-friendly error messages with retry options
- SSL certificate challenges are handled more gracefully
- OAuth token extraction is logged for debugging
- Network security is properly configured for both Android and iOS

## Files Modified

1. `android/app/src/main/res/xml/network_security_config.xml` (new)
2. `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`
3. `lib/views/web_viewer.dart`
4. `ios/Runner/Info.plist`

## Next Steps

1. Test the app on real devices
2. Monitor console logs for OAuth-related messages
3. If issues persist, check the specific error messages and adjust accordingly
4. Consider implementing additional OAuth providers if needed
